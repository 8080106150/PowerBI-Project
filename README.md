# PowerBI-Project

This project will involve integrating Covid-19 data from various sources, building data models, and creating interactive visualizations and reports using Power BI to provide insights into Covid-19 spread, vaccination rates, and the impact on public health and the economy. The dashboard will allow users to explore data at different levels of granularity and identify patterns and trends to inform policy-making and public health decision-making.
